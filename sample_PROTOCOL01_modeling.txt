GOAL   : Create active state homology model of [z] 
INPUTS : Active [x], inactive [y], sequence of [z] 
OUTPUT : Homology model of [z] active state
PROJECT: [z]
PATH   : /home/robin/Work/Dror_rotation/[z]/active_state_model/setup

=====================================================================

1. Built homology model of [z] based on the active state [x] structure [x].pdb,
   and the inactive [y] [y].pdb, by loading those structures into Maestro
   and doing a structure alignment.

2. Opened the multiple sequence viewer and the [z] fasta. Did an alignment
   automatically, then refined as follows:
   
   - Moved residues around across the 3rd loop gap, so the gap is correctly placed
     based on residue number (there is a big skip in numbering where the gap should
     be)
   - Checked the alignment of the following residues (numbering from [x]) is correct
     between all three sequences: TRP158, PRO211, PRO288, PRO323, PRO332.

   I had to move around a few gaps to get the TRP158 in the right position and do some
   minor adjustments of the [x] sequence for the PRO211, then everything else seemed
   to be in the right place.

3. Constructed a composite model. Selected all of the model to come from [y] inactive,
   except for TM5,6,7,8 regions. This translates to the following selections from the
   [y] sequence:

   - FFTNQAY near 3rd loop gap through start of third loop
   - ending with RASK before SRI, but actually just through the end
   - from CLKEH (more like LKEH at end of third loop) through the end

4. Constructed the model with all the boxes checked, with filling in insertions of up
   to 5 residues to handle some minor insertions.

5. Checked over the model in Maestro. The most important thing is that the loop movement
   is preserved of TM7/8 (i think thats the right index but its obvs from visualizing).

6. Ran the protein prep wizard as usual, aligning to the [y] opm structure with propka at ph 7.0
   Saved file: 02WT_active_prepped.mae

7. Dabbled with a membrane buffer of 30 so the system's a decent size,
   and a decreased lipid dist (from 2.0 default) so the lipids are closer:
    dabble -i 02WT_active_prepped.mae -o 02WT_active_dabbled.prmtop -m 30.0 --lipid-dist 1.5 | tee 02dabble.out

8. Outputs are 02WT_active_dabbled.inpcrd and 02WT_active_dabbled.prmtop

9. Repeated for A135F, A135P, A135T, Y209S mutants, using WT alignment as a guide. This took a lot
   less time since Maestro uses the WT alignment as a basis for loading in the other fastas.
